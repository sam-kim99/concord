# Concord

Concord is a Discord clone built using React in the front-end and Rails in the backend. It provides a platform for users to communicate via servers, channels, and messages, with full CRUD functionality for each component.

You can click the Live Demo link to be redirected to a working version of this project. There will be two buttons on the Splash page that will redirect you to the Login/Register page (Get Started With Concord, Login). From there, you can choose to login, register, or use one of the two demo accounts to explore further.
